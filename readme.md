# My Planner Demo

> I've picked Knockout.js for this demo as it helps you simplify dynamic JavaScript UIs using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
> I've used the custom knockout binding handlers along with the simple observables and observable arrays. I've used computed observables for the filtration part tied with routing. Also, used director.js for the routing purpose with hashing.
> I've used the local storage of the browser to store my plans checklist in JSON format.
> I've used the http-server to run the local server and have specified it's command and options in package.json under scrips > "start"
